## Next generation sequencing
Next generation sequencing refers to high-throughput measurement of DNA sequences
using modern technology.  This DNA can be generated in many different ways, most commonly: 

1) directly extracted from cells such as for copy number and variant analysis
2) messenger RNA from genes that are expressed in specific cells can be converted to cDNA
3) extracted DNA having undergone some chemistry such as bisulfite treatment (see below)

There are a bunch of great videos on YouTube, but these are organized lectures to teach 
about NGS experiments and data analysis that you can search for:
1) NCBI Now (videos on commonly used assays, tools, file formats, and even primers on how to use Linux and such)
2) NCBI Minute (shorter videos on specific topics)
3) StatQuest (great general videos that help you understand complicated concepts)
4) Chipster Tutorials (check out the one on Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) which is used a lot)

## Methylation with Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS)
Video that explains what methylation on DNA is used for, how the bisulfate reaction 
can mark methylated cytosines and how we can use sequencing to identify them, and review
computational tools that we can use:
